## What this app is

PickWise: an AI-powered, conversational laptop-recommendation and price-comparison frontend for the Malaysian market. Laptop listing, details, and price history are live against the FastAPI backend (`https://pickwise-v2-backend.onrender.com/api/v2`, repo: `C:\Users\user\Documents\Project\pickwise-v2-backend`); chat, PickScore, and XAI breakdowns are still hardcoded mocks. The design reference is the prototype at `C:\Users\user\Downloads\PickWise Prototype\PickWise v2.dc.html` (design brief: `C:\Users\user\Downloads\PickWise Prototype\uploads\pickwise-v2-design-prompt.md`) — a glassmorphism visual language with a chat agent named **Pico**, **PickScore** rings + **XAI** factor breakdowns, and no live vendor pricing. Match it when building new UI:

- Brand primary is **#042e61** (deep navy). It lives in `globals.css` as `--primary`/`--brand` (`oklch(0.308 0.101 256.5)` light / lighter tint dark).
- No vendor branding, multi-vendor price tables, or buy buttons — purchase intent resolves to a single neutral "View retailer options" link. No stock/availability labels on cards or compare view.
- No fake marketing stats or testimonial carousels; no trophy/medal icons on scores.

## Architecture

Next.js **16.2.10** (App Router) with React 19, TypeScript (strict), and Tailwind CSS v4.

- All source lives under `src/`: routes in `src/app/`, shared components in `src/components/`, data/logic in `src/lib/`. Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/`.
- **Routes**: `/` (Omnibar hero + trending), `/laptops` (browse: search + brand filter + price sort + grid/list view toggle), `/laptops/[id]` (bento-grid details; `params` is a Promise — `await` it; fetches from the backend and 404s via `notFound()` on API 404/422), `/wizard` (6-step needs wizard), `/chat` (Pico chat interface — results/comparison happen inline here), `/compare`, `/saved`, `/login` (merged sign-in/create-account tabs). `/results` and `/signup` are thin redirects to `/chat` and `/login` respectively — kept so old links don't 404.
- **Laptop data comes from two places.** Live pages (`/laptops`, `/laptops/[id]`) are Server Components that fetch via `src/lib/api/` (`client.ts` fetch wrapper, `types.ts` backend shapes, `adapters.ts` `mapBackendLaptop`). The adapter fills `Laptop` fields with no backend source yet (score, radar, xaiFactors, sentiment, …) with neutral placeholders — only safe for views that don't render them (browse uses `showScore={false}`); read the adapter comment before reusing it. `src/lib/laptops.ts` keeps the `Laptop` type and six mock laptops used by home/trending, chat, and compare. Backend `image_urls[]` maps to `images` (all photos) and `image` (first photo); mocks omit `images`, so consumers fall back to `[image]`. Note: scraped Apple `image_urls` include both screen-size variants from shared specs pages (13″+15″, 14″+16″), so galleries show look-alike pairs — a backend scraper issue, not a frontend bug.
- The `/laptops` list is currently fetched whole (~250 laptops, ~700 KB) and searched/filtered/sorted client-side in `laptops-browse.tsx`; `GET /laptops/` takes no query params yet. Plan is to move pagination/filter/sort server-side (backend param support first), so don't deepen the client-side approach.
- Most pages are client components (`"use client"`) because they hold interactive state (wizard steps, chat pro-tuning sliders/compare checkboxes, browse filters, compare tech-row toggle, auth tabs). `components/charts/*` (recharts), `theme-toggle`/`theme-provider` (next-themes) stay isolated client leaves.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` wraps all pages in ThemeProvider (next-themes, class strategy) + Header + Footer. Dark mode is toggled via the `.dark` class; `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` is required.
- `components/laptop-card.tsx` is shared by home/browse (`showScore={false}`, compact) and chat results (`showScore` default true — adds `XaiPopover` + plain-English panel + optional compare checkbox via `compareChecked`/`onCompareChange`). `layout` prop: `"grid"` (default, vertical) or `"list"` (horizontal row, image column left — used by the browse list view). The image area is an embla carousel (`ui/carousel.tsx`) with `CarouselDots` — a custom addition to the shadcn component: sliding window of max 3 dots, hidden for single-image laptops, glass-pill styling passed in from the card. Swipe is intentionally blocked by the stretched-link overlay (z-10) that makes the whole card open the details page; the dots (z-20) are the navigation.
- `components/laptop-gallery.tsx` is the details-page client gallery: selectable thumbnails (one per image, wraps) driving the hero photo.
- **Product photo conventions**: photo panels (card image area, details gallery) use `bg-white` in both themes so transparent-background PNGs read cleanly; photos keep `mix-blend-multiply dark:mix-blend-normal` (multiply is a no-op on white in light mode, normal shows the photo plainly on white in dark mode) — keep both when adding images. Card photos use `object-contain` (no cropping), not `object-cover`.
- Remote images (Unsplash, pravatar, apple.com, ASUS CDN) are allowlisted in `next.config.ts` `images.remotePatterns` — scraped image hosts must be added there or `next/image` throws.

## Styling

- shadcn/ui (base-nova style, base-ui primitives — `render` prop instead of Radix's `asChild`) is configured via `components.json`; generated components go in `src/components/ui/`. Add components with `npx shadcn add <name>`.
- Tailwind v4 is configured in CSS, not JavaScript: there is no `tailwind.config.*` file. Theme customization goes in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme`; the PostCSS plugin is `@tailwindcss/postcss`. Use theme tokens rather than hardcoded palette colors — both the original shadcn set (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, …) and the additive glassmorphism set (`bg-surface`, `bg-surface-2`, `bg-brand`/`bg-brand-tint`, `text-positive`/`text-negative`, `border-line`, plus the raw CSS vars `--glass`/`--glass-edge`/`--shadow` for backdrop/shadow work).
- **Glass surfaces**: use `components/glass-surface.tsx` (plain CSS glassmorphism — translucent fill + `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)` + inner-edge highlight border) for the app's floating/overlay layers only — nav island, chat composer, XAI popover, account menu, sticky compare header, review modal. Never wrap body-level/flat content in it, and never nest one inside another. Don't reach for a third-party glass/liquid-glass package here — an earlier attempt with `liquid-glass-react` broke in-flow layout (it bakes in a self-centering `translate(-50%, -50%)` transform and several `position: relative` decorative sibling elements meant for a single floating button, which inflated container heights and misplaced content) and caused SSR/client hydration mismatches once wired to theme state. Plain CSS has none of those problems.
- Animations are `@theme` tokens in `globals.css` (`animate-fade-in-up`, `animate-float`, `animate-shimmer`, `animate-bounce-dot`). Always gate animations behind the `motion-safe:` variant. Card grids stagger entrances via inline `animationDelay`.
- Chart colors are dataviz-validated (CVD-safe, contrast-checked) — radar pair `#3b6db4`/`#9333ea`, price-history pair `#3b6db4`/`#c2571b` (second series dashed); single-series charts use `#3b6db4` alone. Charts read surface colors from CSS vars (`var(--border)` etc.) so they follow the theme.
- Prices, scores, and other data numbers use the `tabular-nums` utility class for column alignment.

## Auth

Live against the backend's JWT bearer auth. `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` (`useAuth`) owns the session: token in localStorage (`pickwise_token`), trusted only after `GET /auth/me/profile` succeeds; login is OAuth2 form-encoded (`username` field accepts username or email), plus Google sign-in via GIS ID token. `src/lib/api/auth.ts` has the API surface (profile, preferences, avatar). `/login` is the tabbed sign-in/create-account page; registration requires email verification before login works. `/profile` and `/wizard` are auth-gated client-side (redirect to `/login`).

The auth context also tracks `hasPreferences` (fetched from `GET /auth/me/preferences` per session, `null` = signed out/unknown): the header hides the "Needs Wizard" nav entry once it's `true` — after completing the wizard, preference updates happen via the account menu's "Preferences" item → the profile page's "Laptop preferences" card, which links back to `/wizard`. The wizard flips the flag via `markPreferencesSaved()` on save.

## Next.js 16 differs from training data

This Next.js version postdates most training data. The full docs for this exact version are bundled at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (App Router docs under `01-app/`) — check them before using an API you haven't verified. One example of a breaking rename: Middleware is now **Proxy** (`proxy.ts` at project root, not `middleware.ts`).
